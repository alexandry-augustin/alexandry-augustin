<h3 align="center">Data Scientist and Software Developer</h3>

Experienced data scientist and software developer with extensive knowledge in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, Python, and C++ (PhD and postdoctoral level). I have a growing interest in advanced data visualisation to communicate complex information clearly and efficiently. I am always looking to solve new challenges with data to drive insights and make robust predictions for my clients.
